                    <p class="py-6">
                        The var is the oldest keyword to declare a variable in JavaScript. The var keyword was historically used for variable declaration, but it has some unique scoping characteristics that can lead to unexpected behavior in certain situations. It's important to understand how var works and why it's generally considered less preferable than let and const for variable declaration in modern JavaScript.
                        <br>
                        <b>Scope </b>: Variables declared with var are function-scoped, which means they are accessible within the function in which they are
                        declared, regardless of where they are declared within that function They are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global scope. This means that the variable declaration is moved to the top during the compilation phase, but the assignment remains where it is.
                        The variable declared with var outside of any function are attached to the global object. This can potentially lead to global namespace pollution and conflicts with other scripts.

                    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">Question-2: <br>Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h1>
                    <p class="py-6">
                        The value undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. undefined is a
                        type by itself (undefined). Unassigned variables are initialized by JavaScript with a default value of undefined.
                        On the otherhand, null is an object. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value.
                        JavaScript never sets a value to null. That must be done programmatically.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>UseCase of null and undefined </b> <br>
                        When a variable is declared but not assigned a value, it is automatically initialized with undefined. The
                        functions usually do not return undefined. Simply which is not existed is undefined. On the otherhand, we can
                        set a variable or object property to null to clear its previous value. We also used null in conditional
                        statement to check if a value has been intentionally set to noting.

                    <p class="py-6">
                        REST API is a simple and flexible method of accessing web services that does not require any processing. It is an API
                        that adheres to the REST, or representational state transfer, architectural style's design principles. REST technology
                        is often favoured over the more sophisticated Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) technology because it consumes less
                        bandwidth, is simpler, and more adaptable to internet use. It is used to retrieve or provide information from a web
                        service. All REST API connection involves only HTTP requests.
